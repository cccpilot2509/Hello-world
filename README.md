# Hello-world
doin the ho-de-do to da world!

My mother performed a Family Tree search around 1996 and discovered that we are Cherokee Indians!  We were even able to get
registered as such.  I just had to write this down because I had almost forgotten about it.  Note to self:  "Hey!  Your an
Indian!@!"
